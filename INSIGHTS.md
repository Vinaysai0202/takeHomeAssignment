Q3 2024 — Executive Insights

Summary
Q3 shows a clear strength in Services: the Services category contributes the largest share of revenue, driven by recurring and higher-value orders. The Web channel delivers substantial top-line revenue but also shows a noticeably higher return rate than other channels, which reduces net sales and signals potential UX or fulfillment issues. Several individual products (notably Service Plus and a few Gizmo/Widget SKUs) consistently appear among top revenue contributors.

Support & Ops
Support handled a healthy ticket volume with an overall strong resolution rate, but refund-related tickets are a weak point — refund issues take longer and have a lower resolution rate than average. High-priority tickets are generally resolved effectively, showing that escalation paths work; however, some medium-priority and refund cases remain unresolved and deserve process attention.

Recommendations

Run a targeted UX + fulfillment review for the Web checkout funnel to reduce returns.

Deep dive on refund cases: map the end-to-end lifecycle and remove policy/process bottlenecks.

Double down on Services (cross-sell/upsell) — replicate what’s working for lower-performing categories.

Add a support dashboard tracking refund SLA and unresolved medium-priority tickets; assign a short improvement sprint.
